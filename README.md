# Dijkstras_Algorithm

<p>In the following repository I explored dijkstra's algorithm and implemented it in java inside a grid. The grid contains a starting and goal position as well as any number of obstacles. The program efficiently calculates the shortest path from the given starting position to a given goal. Since the grid has cell-to-cell connectivity and equals traversal costs, it has no weighted edges. Underneath are examples of how the search is visualized.</p>
<br>
<p>S = staring position</p>
<p>G = goal position</p>
<p>X = obstacle</p>
<p>- = visited position</p>
<br>

<p>Since we are exploring the grid, most of the grid is shown with a "-" mark.</p>
